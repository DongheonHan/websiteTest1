    <p>On September 22nd, Hoskinson announced a $20M gift to Carnegie Mellon University to create the Hoskinson Center for Formal Mathematics, which is dedicated to the intersection of science, mathematics, philosophy and logic. [13] Formal mathematics has not been revised since the work of David Hilbert in 1900; the goal of the center is to create a new working language starting with work coming out of the Lean community, and will be led by Jeremy Avigad.</p>
