    <p>Currently, I am working as a visiting researcher at the Seoul National University in South Korea, developing Path Tracking Algorithm for an agricultural off-road vehicle.</p>
    <p>I am a mechanical engineer currently applying for a Ph.D. program. </p>
    <p>I graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Summer 2021. Before attending Georgia Tech, I went to Atlanta Metropolitan State College (AMSC) where my passion for engineering started. At AMSC I studied physics, and transferred to Georgia Tech to apply my knowledge to more practical areas.</p>
    <p>At Georgia Tech, I was involved in various engrossing projects which rendered my motivation to be involved in graduate-level research. </p>

    <h3>1. Implementation and Development of a Tractor’s Path Tracking Algorithm Based on Dynamic Target Control</h3>
    
    <p>Recently, due to the development of IT convergence technology, environmental implantation sensor technology, and the low cost of the controller, the autonomous vehicle industries are rapidly developing. This study develops a path tracking algorithm based on autonomous steering control technology, which is one of the core technologies among autonomous driving technologies. </p>
    <p>In order to develop a path tracking algorithm, the kinematic state (position coordinates, heading angle, steering angle) of the vehicle was updated using a two-dimensional bicycle model, which is simplified modeling of the lateral movement of the vehicle. The desired path was created based on the waypoints, and the head angle and distance of the tractor from the desired path were used as an error.</p>

    <h3>2. Blower Tip’s Variable Nozzle Design Sponsored by TTI (Techtronic Industries)</h3>
    
    <p>There currently is high demand for a continuously variable nozzle attachment for leaf blowers. The idea of a continuously variable nozzle is that the user can adjust the airspeed of the blower with minimal input, for various applications such as removing heavier debris, like wet grass/leaves from a sidewalk.  </p>
    <p>The current solution to increasing the speed is using attachments called “speed tips,” which come in various shapes and sizes/diameters. Techtronic Industries (TTI) has tasked the team with developing a simple solution in order to reduce part count in the purchase of a leaf blower. In addition, since the significant geometry change of the blower tip could cause turbulence that could stall the blower’s motor, the output air has to have a minimum flow rate of 550 CFM.</p>

    <h3>3. Computer-Aided Manufacturing and Dynamic Analysis of a Six Degree of Freedom Stewart Platform Manipulator</h3>
    <p>The research project in the Georgia Tech LIDAR (Laboratory for Intelligent Decision and Autonomous Robots) proposes to make a robot called Athena that mimics human behavior and achieves human-level agility. The team had been working on Athena’s upper body and needed a neck platform that connects the upper body and the head. </p>
    <p>Most robots’ neck platforms consisted of 3 to 4 degrees of freedom serial manipulators. However, the human’s neck has more complicated kinematic aspect - 24 degrees of freedom and 8 links. In order to make neck movement that is more similar to humans, it was decided that the manipulating structure that uses 6 degrees of freedom Stewart platform was suitable for the humanoid neck movement.</p>

    <h3>4. Structural Analysis of Horizontal-axis Wind Turbine base on CFD and FEA</h3>
    <p>Nowadays, renewable energy, particularly wind power energy, is one of the fastest-growing renewable energy resources. Wind turbines, as an alternative source of energy to fossil fuels, can reduce CO2 emissions and pollution. Therefore, scientists in recent years have begun to take an interest in using wind energy. As the demand for renewable energy grows, the wind industry is finding ways to boost the energy output of wind turbines. One way to increase energy from turbines is to increase the size of the rotor blades (weighing around 36 tons) in order to produce more power. </p>
    <p>The increasing size of blades can put more pressure on the structure and other components in the turbine, and the additional pressure increases the chance of blade failure. This project will focus on (1) obtaining wind turbine blade’s lift and drag ratio from CFD, (2) calculate the pressure distribution at the different airspeeds, and (3) estimating the factor of safety and maximum displacement from FEA.</p>
