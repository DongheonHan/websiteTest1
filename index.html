    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>I am a mechanical engineer currently applying for a Ph.D. program. </p>
    <p>I graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology (Bachelor of Science, Mechanical Engineering) in Summer 2021. Before I attending the Georgia Institute of Technology, I went to Atlanta Metropolitan State College (AMSC) where my passion for engineering started from. In AMSC I studied physics (Associate of Science, Physics 18â€™), and in order to applicate my knowledge to more practical areas, I transferred to the Georgia Institute of Technology. 
    </p>
    <p>When I was at the Georgia Institute of Technology I was involved in some interesting projects which gave me a lot of motivation to be involved in graduate-level research. 
    </p>
    <p>My former projects were related to robotics/control, fluid mechanics, and CAE and design. </p>
    <p>My research interests are robotics/control and fluid mechanics. </p>
